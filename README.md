## Opening Move Database

The opening move database (Opening Book) contains over 2000 openings, persisted as a tree data structure - each move coresponding to a node. Each node has a weight coresponding to the amount of times the opening has been played in Master Games, indicating the lines strength. The AI selects a line from a randomizing function which depends on the players moves, the weight, and the depth (strength) setting. The opening book structure is persisted in ./resources/structures/opening_book.txt

### Add Openings

Write new openings to a .cvs file in the following format

```
A04    Reti: King's Indian Attack
1.Nf3 g6 2.g3 Bg7 3.Bg2 e5 4.O-O Nc6 5.e4 d6 6.d3 Nge7 7.c3 O-O 8.Nbd2 h6 9.b4 1/2
```

Then run OpeningBookParser.java with the file as an argument
